Prof, Neurology and Neurological Sciences</i><br><i>kandreas@stanford.edu</i><br>We are interested in understanding the mechanisms by which neuroinflammation elicits synaptic and neuronal injury in chronic and acute models of neurological disease. Our foot in the door has been the study of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway and its downstream prostaglandin receptor signaling pathways, which we have discovered function in very important ways in modulating the inflammatory response in brain in models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke.  Thus this pathway functions across a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, and may potentially modulate inflammatory responses and neuronal injury via conserved cellular and molecular mechanisms.   We use genetic and pharmacologic strategies as well as in vitro culture approaches to define COX-2/prostaglandin receptor mediated mechanisms of action in eliciting synaptic and neuronal injury in these models of human neurological disease.   Our long-term goal is to (1) further understand how neuroinflammatory processes injure synapses and neurons and disrupt circuits,  (2) define the contribution of the COX-2/prostaglandin signaling pathways in this process, and (3) develop therapeutic strategies targeting prostaglandin G-protein coupled receptors in human neurological diseases.<br><br>	</tr>

Regenerative medicine entails increasing the plasticity of cell fate.  However, this increase in cellular plasticity also increases the chances of cancer.  For example, to produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), two of the four Yamanaka proteins are onco-proteins (c-Myc and Klf4).  To create cells for regeneration by dedifferentiation, the activity of two tumor suppressors (RB and p61/p19) is transiently inhibited.  Thus, in order to enlist cells for tissue regeneration, the chances for cancer are increased and must be carefully monitored.  We have shown that by non-invasive imaging by bioluminescence (BLI) we can distinguish in a dynamic and quantitative manner whether injected cells are functioning as expected for regeneration or have gone awry as in cancer.  For example, the development of additional radiological methods for tracking single human cells delivered in vivo (e.g. using nanoparticles) has clear potential application in distinguishing tumorigenic or normal regenerative behavior.  For regenerative medicine to succeed, cancer must be prevented, detected and controlled.  Radiologic tools and technologies are invaluable to both regeneration and cancer and more such methods need to be developed and actively employed.  This is a strong multidisciplinary focus of my laboratory.<br><br>	</tr>

In the United States, there are 4 million people currently living with the effects of stroke, and another 4.3 million living with the effects of traumatic brain injury. Of the people who have had a stroke, many are disabled to the degree that they cannot work, and a significant proportion are unable to walk, feed themselves, or communicate with their families the way they could prior to their stroke. Despite this very high number of people who are suffering, there is a large knowledge gap regarding the mechanisms by which neurological recovery occurs, and not a single FDA-approved therapy available to help people recover. There is reason to think that such a therapy might be obtainable – we know that some people, especially younger ones, experience significant recovery after stroke. Animal studies, almost entirely done in young animals, also demonstrate significant recovery after neurological injury. Our goal is thus to better understand the mechanisms that contribute to recovery in the young, and how they are influenced by inflammatory responses. Once we understand this, we hope to be able to develop new therapies to help people’s brains repair themselves.

Current projects in the lab:

TGF-beta signaling after brain injury. To understand the role of TGF-beta signaling after brain injury, we use mouse models to manipulate and image TGF-beta signaling after stroke, viral vectors to influence TGF-beta signaling in neural progenitor cells, and small molecule therapies in a time-restricted fashion. We measure the effects on functional recovery from brain injury, the cellular and molecular immune response, and cell-specific signaling pathways.

The effect of small molecule neurotrophin agonists on functional recovery. In collaboration with the Longo lab, which has developed these compounds, we are testing whether small molecule compounds that mimic NGF and BDNF can be used to improve recovery and stimulate regenerative responses after brain injury.

Imaging and manipulating regenerative responses after brain injury. Constructing novel mouse models to allow for real-time imaging and manipulation of neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in mice as they recover from brain injury.

Peripheral immune responses and brain edema after stroke. In collaboration with researchers at the Stanford Stroke Center we plan to evaluate serum samples from patients with stroke. Our goal is to understand the peripheral immune mechanisms that correlate with the development of brain edema, or swelling, and determine if there are ways to predict which patients may require more aggressive treatment for their strokes.<br><br>	</tr>

Clinical experience and data suggest that abnormalities in the regulation of emotional processing, in particular through mechanisms operating outside of awareness (i.e. implicit) are central to a range of psychopathology. Thus, our investigation of psychopathology and treatment is organized around affective neuroscience of emotion regulation.

 Implicit emotion regulation: A successful affective neuroscience approach to psychopathology and treatment requires understanding the basic mechanisms involved in emotion regulation. Although our initial work thus far has yielded important insights, we are far from a thorough understanding of how emotion is implicitly regulated. Ongoing work in the lab is focused on understanding the factors which govern implicit emotion regulation, the relationship between implicit and explicit regulation, and whether there are ways to improve implicit emotion regulation through training.

Neural basis of psychopathology: Our recent work suggests that a deficit in implicit emotion regulation may be a core feature of anxiety, which is evident in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), including in the context of major depressive disorder (MDD). We are also currently examining how patients with different, but related, conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain implicitly regulate emotion and how this reflects common versus disorder-specific neural signatures. In taking a life-span perspective on implicit emotion regulation, we are also currently studying older healthy subjects and those with geriatric anxiety or depression. 

Neural mechanisms of treatment: Very little is known about the mechanisms of action of existing treatments in psychiatry, which is particularly true of psychotherapy, despite the importance of this clinical tool. An important goal of the lab is understanding the neural processes involved in treatment for anxiety or depression, in terms of (a) which domains of neural/mental functions are involved, (b) how different approaches yield their effects, (c) how individual differences in capacities like emotion regulation underlie differential outcome, and (d) how the mechanisms of change with medication relate to and interact with those involved in psychotherapy. We are currently NIH-funded to study the emotion regulation mechanisms underlying exposure therapy for PTSD.

Neural circuits subserving emotion: An element integral to the studies above is a delineation of the neural circuits that underlie emotion processing. We have, for example, demonstrated that the major amygdalar subregions in humans have distinct patterns of resting-state functional connectivity, which are perturbed in GAD. Ongoing work in the lab is focused on extending this mapping of circuitry important for emotion, using functional connectivity, in both healthy subjects and patients with mood or anxiety disorders.<br><br>	</tr>

Both diseases result from damage to the axons at the beginning of the optic nerve called the optic nerve head, where 1.2 million axons converge, take a 90-degree turn to form bundles of axons that connect with other visual areas of the brain.  Through mechanisms we do not understand, both ischemic optic neuropathy and glaucoma affect predominantly older adults, suggesting an age-dependent susceptibility of the retinal ganglion cell axons at the optic nerve head. AION can be successfully modeled in mouse using laser-stimulated photochemical thrombosis of the small peri-papillary vessels.  Using this model, we have evaluated key events following AION and identified potential targets and treatment modalities. We are studying potential neuroprotective agents that may salvage retinal ganglion cells or optic nerve following injury, and we use in vitro as well as non-invasive in vivo imaging techniques including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and fluorescence confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. We are also studying the potential of using stem cell transplantation to treat AION since the central nervous system has limited repair and regenerative capacity. We have developed substantial experience (> 200 mice) with intravitreal stem cell transplantation using mouse animal models. We show that neural progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cells (ES-NPCs) can be transplanted into young mouse eyes (P3-5) in large numbers. In contrast, transplantation into adult eyes is much less efficacious, although some cells survived 8-months following transplantation in small numbers. In trying to increase the efficacy of transplantation, we found that retinal laser photocoagulation, a form of controlled injury used routinely to treat some patients with diabetic retinopathy, significantly enhanced the efficacy of transplantation in adult mice. We are continuing our study on manipulations of the neural progenitors as well as the host to optimize regenerative therapy in the adult retina.<br><br>	</tr>

Our research program focuses on two main areas: neural circuit development related to thyroid hormone, and development and function of the hair cell through action of motor molecules with scaffolding proteins. 

Our ongoing research investigates the role of thyroid hormone for the timely coordination of a complex set of neural differentiation events in the maturing cochlea. This includes research on the mechanisms that prompt the progression of axonal projections and synapse formation. We are using mouse genetic manipulations and a variety of molecular and physiological approaches to identify new genes involved in regulating cochlear hair cell innervation.

The second line of research focuses on functional characterization of myosin motors in establishing and maintaining normal hearing and/or vision. Several myosin genes are involved in syndromic and non-syndromic forms of deafness (http://webhost.ua.ac.be/hhh/) but the physiological function of other myosins remains unexplored. The discovery of new molecular motors that are involved in sensory perception and knowledge of their specific roles and cargos will lead to better understanding the differentiation and the function of inner ear hair cells. Genes encoding proteins that interact with myosins comprise another important group of deafness loci. We are using mouse genetic technology to elucidate the role of these motor molecules in hair cell function.


In the long term we are interested in translating the lessons learned in mice to understanding human deafness. We anticipate that the mouse and human genetic studies will be synergistic in advancing our understanding of hearing loss.

We use molecular, genetic and cell biological tools to study this question in the nematode, C. elegans, which has a very simple nervous system containing only 302 neurons and approximately 6000 synapses.
We are also interested in understanding how synapses are eliminated.  During development, synapse formation is always accompanied by synapse elimination.  It is the balance between these two events that eventually lead to the maturation of synaptic circuit.  Very little is known about synapse elimination.  We are using genetic approaches to study this.

The accurate allocation of mitochondria in neurons is particularly critical due to the significance of mitochondria for ATP supply, Ca++ homeostasis and apoptosis and the importance of these functions to the distal extremities of neurons. In addition, defective mitochondria, which can be highly deleterious to a cell because of their output of reactive oxygen species, need to be repaired by fusing with healthy mitochondria or cleared from the cell. Thus mitochondrial cell biology poses critical questions for all cells, but especially for neurons: how the cell sets up an adequate distribution of the organelle; how it sustains mitochondria in the periphery; and how mitochondria are removed after damage. The goal of my research is to understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling mitochondrial dynamics and function and the mechanisms by which even subtle perturbations of these processes may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders.<br><br>	</tr>

Our focus is on epigenetic reprogramming i.e. ways to induce cell fate changes by defined factors such as the reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem (or iPS) cells. More recently, we have demonstrated that mouse fibroblasts can directly be converted to functional neuronal cells that we termed induced neuronal (iN) cells (Vierbuchen et al., 2010, Nature). The iN cells were generated through expression of the three transcription factors Ascl1, Myt1l, and Brn2. This surprising discovery opened the door to a new area of investigation. We are currently working to apply our finding to human cells, explore the molecular mechanism of the action of the three transcription factors, and determine the neuronal subtype of resulting iN cells. A long term goal is to use this method to evaluate whether iN cells can be used to model neurological diseases.

In addition, the emerging iPS cell technology provides new fascinating translational applications such as patient-specific stem cell therapy or disease phenocopy through differentiation into the neural lineage. Our lab has developed new methods to generate iPS cells from human fibroblasts with defined mutations and explores various technologies to improve gene targeting in human iPS cells with a long term goal to correct disease-causing mutations. This work is made possible through a very generous CIRM grant.

Another interest of the laboratory is to study self-renewal and differentiation in neural stem/progenitor cells and apply these findings to  the tumor precursor cells of glioblastoma. This will shed some light into glioma generation and potentially lead to alternative treatment strategies of this devastating brain disease.<br><br>	</tr>
