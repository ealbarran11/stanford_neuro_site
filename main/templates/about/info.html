    <h2>Program Info</h2>
    <p>The Stanford Neurosciences Graduate Program is an interdisciplinary, interdepartmental training program leading to the PhD degree in Neuroscience. The primary goal of the program is to train predoctoral PhD students to become leaders in neuroscience research, education and outreach. The training program has been designed to be broadly based during the first two years, prior to full-time thesis work. Breadth is achieved through coursework and through mandatory laboratory rotations which develop students' skills in modern methods of neuroscience research before they become fully involved in thesis research. The training plan includes a set of core areas with appropriate course offerings to make students fluent in the multidisciplinary language and approaches of the neurosciences, ranging from molecules to systems. Formal classroom instruction and intensive graduate seminars familiarize students with the current state of the field, equipping them intellectually for hands-on research in the laboratory.</p>
	
	<p>After initiating thesis research in a specific laboratory, students learn how to approach and solve research problems of fundamental significance, thus advancing our understanding of nervous system function and dysfunction at all levels. We expect that graduates of our program will be innovators, investigators, and teachers whose programs are founded on research, with most ultimately ending up in academic positions. A recent analysis indicates that the large majority of graduates indeed follow this path first starting as postdocs and then obtaining faculty positions.</p>

	<p>All neuroscience graduate students at Stanford enroll in the Interdepartmental Neurosciences Program, which is the only academic body at Stanford that awards a Ph.D. in the neurosciences. By design, departments at Stanford do not compete for students with a neuroscience interest. The departments have wisely realized that their research and teaching missions are best served by access to a single, extremely high quality pool of students who are attracted to a campus-wide and uniformly strong neurosciences graduate program.</p>

	<p>The Neurosciences Program:
	<ul>
		<li>Selects students for admission and monitors their progress in the program</li>
		<li>Immerses them in an intensive 2 week orientation and cellular/molecular lab course (SIN)</li>
		<li>Provides a set of courses that cover virtually all areas of research in the neurosciences from genes and molecules to systems and behavior and the role of these areas on human disease</li>
		<li>Conducts a weekly student journal club/course for all students, including presentations from scientists, administrators, and journal editors on professional ethics and development</li>
		<li>Sponsors an annual retreat at Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey, as well as a seminar series featuring leading neuroscientists from around the country</li>
		<li>Supports additional educational opportunities for students through participation in summer specialty courses at Woodâ€™s Hole, Cold Spring Harbor, and other venues</li>
		<li>Provides entering students with the opportunity to experience research in three or four labs via a rotation system before choosing their thesis advisor</li>
		<li>Enables students to interact, develop intellectual interests, and obtain research training of a far broader scope than would be possible from the offerings of any single department</li>
		<li>Promotes outreach activities both within and outside of the Stanford community, including visits to local schools in disadvantaged communities.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The signature feature of the Stanford Neurosciences Program is the combination of outstanding faculty researchers and exceedingly bright, energetic students in a community that shares a firm and longstanding commitment to understanding the nervous system at all its levels of function.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>An interdisciplinary neuroscience PhD program has existed at Stanford since 1962. The original
philosophy behind the program (and as it remains today) was to offer a single, coherent program in neuroscience as opposed to several small competing programs. The program was to be governed by faculty members on an interdepartmental basis. No single department was to dominate. The directors of the program have been:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Frank Morrell (Professor and Chairman, Division of Neurology), 1962-68</li>
	<li>K.L. Chow (Professor of Neurology), 1968-72</li>
	<li>Eric Shooter (then Professor of Genetics and Biochemistry), 1972-82</li>
	<li>Stephen Waxman (Professor of Neurology), 1982-86</li>
	<li>U.J. McMahan (Professor and Chairman, Department of Neurobiology), 1986-92</li>
	<li>Howard Schulman (Professor of Molelcular Pharmacology and subsequently of Neurobiology), 1992-99</li>
	<li>Eric Knudsen (Professor of Neurobiology), 1999-2001</li>
	<li>William Newsome (Professor of Neurobiology), 2001-2005</li>
	<li>John Huguenard (Professor of Neurology), 2006-2013</li>
	<li>Tony Ricci (Professor of Otolaryngology), 2013-</li>
</ol>
<p>The original training program underwent several transformations before becoming the Neurosciences Graduate Program of today. During the early years (1962-72), financial resources came entirely from faculty research grants and only supported a small program of three students per year. An NIMH training grant to the Department of Psychiatry under the leadership of Drs. Seymour Levine and David Hamburg in1972 allowed significant expansion of the program. In 1975 the School of Medicine established the Department of Neurobiology with Dr. Eric Shooter as the founding Chair. For the first time at Stanford, a concentration of highly talented investigators in basic neuroscience provided a focal point of organization and energy for promoting neuroscience development on a campus-wide basis. By design the Department
of Neurobiology did not offer its own PhD, but rather chose to cooperate with all other neuroscientists on the Stanford campus to run a single, excellent graduate program.</p>
