<h1>Admissions Info</h1>
</div>

<p>Our admissions committee typically selects top students from diverse educational and cultural backgrounds. We base our selection on the student's academic achievements, letters of recommendation attesting to the student's research and academic skills, statement of purpose, and Graduate Record Examination scores. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the Neurosciences, students are enrolled with backgrounds ranging from computational to biological. Students from traditional biology backgrounds are expected to show strong achievement in molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry and neuroscience. Students from more quantitative backgrounds should demonstrate considerable competence in mathematics (calculus, differential equations, linear algebra), physics, probability theory, and statistics. Students from psychology backgrounds should be well versed in cognitive science, experimental psychology, neuroscience and statistics. We are looking primarily for talented, highly motivated students irrespective of exact disciplinary background. Similarly, research experience is very important, but the exact disciplinary area is not critical. </p>
<p>We are committed to training a diverse group of neuroscientists which arise from a wide range of ethnic, cultural, educational, and socioeconomic backgrounds.&nbsp; In addition we will provide reasonable accommodations to those with disabilities.&nbsp; We welcome applications from all qualified individuals.</p>
<p class="well">To apply to the Neurosciences Program, please go to the <a
href="http://biosciences.stanford.edu/admissions.html">Graduate Application</a> page to access the electronic admissions application.   <strong>Note:</strong> The deadline for receipt of completed
applications for all Bioscience programs is December 3rd, 2013, for
admission in the Autumn, 2014.  <strong>Stanford Biosciences has only a single
interview weekend, February 26th - March 2nd, 2014</strong>, so please plan your
interview schedules accordingly. <br /><br />

<p>Students admitted to the Neurosciences Program are funded by
training grants or predoctoral fellowships from for example NSF or NDSEG that provide for stipend, tuition and funds for travel. Stipends are augmented from their NIH levels to be competitive with other neurosciences programs in the country. </p>
<p>Qualified applicants who are neither U.S. citizens nor
permanent residents are also accepted into the Program as the University offers a
limited number of fellowships to outstanding incoming students, and international applicants are eligible
for nomination for these fellowships.  If you are an international
	applicant and feel that you are competitive for our program, i.e. with strong neuroscience interests and research
	experience and superb academic credentials, we encourage you to apply.


	</p>
	<p>We strongly encourage all eligible students (U.S. citizens
	and permanent residents) to apply for predoctoral fellowships from the
	National Science Foundation or the Ford Foundation. Our students have been very competitive for these prestigious fellowships in past years. <strong>Note:</strong> The deadline for receipt of completed applications for all fellowships is the first week of November.</p>
