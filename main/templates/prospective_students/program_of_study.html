            <div class="accordion-inner"><p>The goal of the Neurosciences Program is to teach students how to approach and solve research problems in Neuroscience. We do this by developing students' skills in modern methods of neuroscience research, their ability to appraise the scientific literature and make scientific judgements, to be self-confident and skillful in communicating research results and ultimately to function as independent creative neuroscientists. Students work closely with faculty, postdoctoral fellows and other students to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>The quality of our students is one of the major assets of the Program. The intellectual and social atmosphere created by interactions among our students is as important as the instruction provided by the faculty.</p>
<p>Laboratory rotations provide students with hands-on experience in a variety of approaches and methods. Students are required to complete 3 rotations in their first year. Rotations enable students to make informed decisions about the faculty mentor and the research area for their Ph.D. thesis. They also provide a wonderful vehicle to get to know and learn from several faculty members and their laboratory groups, and identify potential thesis committee members. Within our flexible system, students may rotate or even carry out their dissertation research in any of the other Stanford Ph.D. programs in the biomedical sciences.</p></div>

            <div class="accordion-inner">In the fall of 2005, we initiated a new <a href="http://neuroscienceprogram.stanford.edu/SIN">boot camp</a> for incoming program students (see photos of the 2009 boot camp <a href="http://neuroscience.stanford.edu/education/phd_program/bootcamp.html">here</a>).&nbsp;This intensive experience focuses on cellular and molecular aspects of neuroscience research.&nbsp;S.I.N. is a two week course offered just before the start of the autumn quarter, and is comprised of lectures and labs where students learn a host of modern neuroscience techniques, such as electrophysiology, calcium imaging, membrane receptor trafficking as monitored via time-lapse videography, synaptic physiology, biochemical analysis of transporter function, and hair-cell function.&nbsp;S.I.N. faculty include Craig Garner, Lu Chen, Shaul Hestrin, John Huguenard, and Tony Ricci. </div>

                <p class="text_bodynormal">Following S.I.N., students are encouraged to begin a series of laboratory rotations as soon as possible after arriving. Although many students enter with an idea about research interests and possibly an advisor, these typically change during graduate school. Laboratory rotations enable students to make, confirm or modify these important decisions based on research experience. Rotations allow students to experience the intellectual and social atmosphere of three lab groups and become familiar with invaluable experimental approaches and techniques. In addition, students form friendships with faculty members, as well as with students and postdocs in their laboratory, who often become life-long scientific collaborators. Rotations are not limited to faculty in the Neurosciences Program. Students may even elect to change to any of the other biomedical Ph.D. Programs at Stanford during their first year. By the end of the first year students choose a laboratory to conduct their thesis project and an advisory committee that will guide them through their choices of advanced courses and research effort.</p>
                <p class="text_bodynormal"><a name="required" id="required"></a>Another important objective for first-year students is to begin to solidify their knowledge of modern neuroscience. Required <a href="/students/courses">courses</a> are kept to a minimum to allow students to tailor their coursework to their needs and to provide sufficient time for laboratory research. All students are required to complete a basic course in neurobiology (Neurobiology 206). During the first two years students are also required to take  courses in all of the following three categories: Cellular/Molecular, Systems/Computational, and Translational.</p>
                <p>In addition, students participate in a Professional Development Course/Journal Club, which develops their skills in critically evaluating papers and in effectively presenting scientific information orally. This course also informs students about writing grants, applying for jobs, and the culture of science. It also assures that all students see each other weekly and facilitates social and intellectual pursuits. A wealth of other courses are offered at Stanford in allied disciplines such as biochemistry and molecular biology, cellular and developmental biology, genetics, immunology, psychology and computer sciences. These, as well as more advanced or specialized courses, are chosen to reflect the student's interests.</p>
	<p class="text_bodynormal"><strong>MSTP, Medical Students, and students matriculating in other Ph.D. Programs.</strong></p>
	<p class="text_bodynormal"> Students can also choose the Neurosciences Program while enrolled at Stanford in the Medical Scientists Training Program (MSTP), as medical students. Approximately one-fourth of our Neurosciences students are also Stanford medical students, or in other Ph.D. Programs. The strength of the neurosciences student body and of the faculty, as well as the important role of the neurosciences to human biology and health, make this an attractive Program for medical students. The global admissions process enables students to begin their first year of graduate studies in other Programs and switch to Neurosciences if their interests change. Such students may find the Neurosciences Program attractive because of the interdisciplinary nature of the neurosciences as well as the excellence of our students and faculty. The timing of the program may be adjusted to fit the special circumstances of these students.</p>

                <p class="text_bodynormal">The second year is occupied by the initiation of a thesis project, filling in needed course work and preparation for the Qualifying Examination. The student is guided in this by a four member Thesis Advisory Committee that is selected by the beginning of the second year. The Qualifying Examination is taken by the end of the second year in the program (with the exception of combined M.D./Ph.D. students) after students have taken the required courses and have had an opportunity with their advisor to define a thesis project. The intent of the examination is to insure that the student i) can critically evaluate selected topics in neuroscience; ii) has an appropriate thesis proposal and understands how it will address an important hypothesis that is being tested.</p>

The Ph.D. program, including research and dissertation typically takes five years to complete. This event culminates with a public seminar presenting the student's research findings followed by an examination of the candidate by the Thesis Committee.</p>

            <p class="text_bodynormal">A number of learning opportunities are available throughout the student's stay at Stanford and complement the formal course work.</p>
	<p class="text_bodynormal"><b>Annual Retreat</b><br />
	Students in the Neurosciences Program organize an annual retreat in the Spring Quarter which serves to familiarize new students with their peers and faculty. Students choose guest speakers who present their work, along with selected senior students, in an informal setting. The two-day retreat is held at the Hopkins Marine Station, by the ocean on the Monterey Bay Peninsula.</p>
	<p class="text_bodynormal"><b>Weekly Neurosciences Graduate Student luncheon</b><br />
	All neuroscience students participate in the required class
	&quot;Professional Development and Integrity in Neuroscience&quot; In
	this course, faculty present discussions about grantsmanship, oral and
	graphical presentation of data, authorship and scientific ethics
	(topics include Conflict of interest, Data acquisition
	and ownership, Peer review, Responsible authorship, and Research
	misconduct). The bulk of the course, however, consists of students' selecting and presenting articles from the current literature for critical discussion.</p>
	<p class="text_bodynormal">Our students also take advantage of several weekly seminar series hosted by many departments and featuring speakers from around the world. Students not only become aware of the frontiers of neuroscience, but get an opportunity to meet neuroscientists who may become their postdoctoral mentors and future colleagues. Journal clubs are held throughout the campus that focus on cell biology and physiology, biochemistry, genetics and developmental biology. Students also keep in touch with their peers at Berkeley and UCSF through annual get-togethers.</p>
