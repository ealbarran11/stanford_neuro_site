        <div class="accordion-heading"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2" href="#q1">Is there a minimum GPA?  Is there a minimum GRE score? Is there a particular TOEFL score required? What field do most accepted applicants come from? Must I have publications in order to be admitted into the program? What is the average age of students in the program? How important is research experience?</a>

            <div class="accordion-inner">There is no one “right” way into the Neurosciences Program and no one “composite” Neurosciences Program student.  Our admissions committee works very hard to holistically evaluate each applicant.  We typically select top students from diverse educational and cultural backgrounds and base our selection on a variety of factors, including academic achievements, letters of recommendation attesting to research and academic skills, statement of purpose, and Graduate Record Examination scores. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the Neurosciences, students are enrolled with backgrounds ranging from computational to biological; we are looking primarily for talented, highly motivated students with evidence of creativity and scientific rigor, irrespective of exact disciplinary background. Similarly, research experience is very important, but the exact disciplinary area is not critical.  Furthermore, we are committed to training a diverse group of neuroscientists which arise from a wide range of ethnic, cultural, educational, and socioeconomic backgrounds; in addition we will provide reasonable accommodations to those with disabilities.  In short, we welcome applications from all qualified individuals.</div>

            <div class="accordion-inner">The GRE subject test is not required.  Should you choose to take the subject test, any of them are suitable except perhaps the English literature test.  Some applicants opt to take the Biology test.</div>

        <div id="q4" class="accordion-body collapse">
            <div class="accordion-inner">Qualified applicants who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents are also accepted into the Program as the University offers a limited number of fellowships to outstanding incoming students, and international applicants are eligible for nomination for these fellowships. If you are an international applicant and feel that you are competitive for our program, i.e. with strong neuroscience interests and research experience and superb academic credentials, we encourage you to apply.</div>

            <div class="accordion-inner">Unfortunately, we are not in the position to offer specific course advice, but, as a general rule, students from traditional biology backgrounds are expected to show strong achievement in molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry and neuroscience. Students from more quantitative backgrounds should demonstrate considerable competence in mathematics (calculus, differential equations, linear algebra), physics, probability theory, and statistics. Students from psychology backgrounds should be well versed in cognitive science, experimental psychology, neuroscience and statistics.</div>

            <div class="accordion-inner">The Neurosciences Program is part of the Biosciences program, which includes 13 other programs (http://biosciences.stanford.edu/); you may apply to 3 programs within the Biosciences group.  For example, you might apply to Neurosciences, Biology, and Genetics – or any combination of 3 programs.  You do not have to apply to 3, however.  Flexible admissions also means that if you are admitted into one of the Biosciences programs and then later decide that another of the 13 Biosciences programs is a better fit for you, the process of transferring to another department within the Biosciences is less difficult than transferring to another department on campus.</div>
